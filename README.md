# in React we use MODULAR js. 
what i mean is like we use type='module' attribute in script tag.
# React Projects use build process.
Browser doesn't support React code.
What i mean is, the code we write is not the code that gets executed in browser
Our code is transformed before it's handed off to the browser.


Raw, unprocessed React code won't execute in the browser. JSX is not a default JavaScript feature.
